; CharStream is sequence of character from standard input.

; Line is an one of:
; - [Array-of Char ... Char Nul]
; - [Array-of Char ... Char Newline Nul]

; TextFile is
; - [Array Null]; an empty file.
; - [Array-of Line ... Line Null]




;=======================================================================================;
; CharStream -> TextFile
; build array of line from the given standard input; return length
build_lines
	for (initial length zero; while there's another line; increment length)
		build line
	return length

; CharStream -> String
; build line as a string from the given standard input; return string pointer
build_line

	if (is newline)
		build string
		return string
	else
		while (is not newline character)
			build string
		return string
		

; TextFile -> TextFile
; print the last 10 lines of its input.
tail afile
	determine how many line in afile
	determine the starting line position
	for (current line; while there's another line; increment current line)
		if (current line position is less than starting line position)
			do nothing
		else if (current line position is greater than or equal to stating line position)
			write line
